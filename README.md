# Chat with the GitHub Docs with Copilot

This is a [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) extension that uses Copilot to search the GitHub Docs. This expects you already have Raycast installed.

## Starting the extension

1. Clone the repository
2. `npm install` && `npm run dev`

Next and with the development server running, follow [these steps](https://developers.raycast.com/basics/contribute-to-an-extension#develop-the-extension) in Raycast to import the extension into Raycast.

## Using the extension 

In Raycast, start typing "Search GitHub Docs". Hit `enter` and then type your query. Type `cmd + enter` to search the GitHub Docs with Copilot. 

The API may take a few seconds, but you should see the results in the Raycast window.
